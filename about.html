    <!--Bio Section-->
<p>My name is James Lewis. After many years working various jobs in TV, i decided i needed something much more reliable. I am currently learning Software Development to hopefully be able to build a career in the tech industry in a world becoming more and more digital by the day.</p> 
<p>I studied at Halliford Secondary School for my GCSE's before moving to Strodes College to do my AS levels. I then switched to The Academy of Contemporary music to get my Batchelors Degrees in Music Performance, specialising in guitar. Since then i have worked in various industries, i worked as a musician in a band for a few years, before needing to change career. i switched to animation, however the passion and rewarding work were fleeting. the last few years i have been working in TV and Film as a mixture of Supporting Artist (Extra) and as a Set Runner</p>
<p>The bootcamp i am currently taking has given me a good foundational knowledge in webdesign using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A good knowledge of working with and creating Databases with SQL and lastly we have been taught how to work with Python.</p> 
<p>I have always messed around with computers, be it "breaking" various software like Autodesk:Maya or modding [and breaking] various games.</p>
