<h2 class="heading2">About Me</h2>
<div class="text1">Hello! My name is James Lewis, i have been interested in computers and how they work for years, but it was only recently i considered it could be a career.</p>
    <p>I worked in TV for a few years as an <b>Extra/Supporting Artist</b> before switching to behind the camera as a <b>Set Runner</b>. I then transition to <b>3D Animation</b>, which took a long time to learn and the work was not as rewarding as i hoped.</p> 
    <p>Having always been tech savvy most my life, be it tinkering with mods for video games to make them work or trying to create plugins for maya, i decided to try my hand at software engineering and found it lit a passion to keep learning and developing my skills in this field</p></div>
